#### Overall thoughts on Ramen
In this section I talk about my history with ramen, to hopefully give an underlying base for my review. This is completely my opinion, but I may insult certain ramen chains that exist in Melbourne. Feel free to skip this section if you want.

In terms of Ramen, after trying it when visiting Japan, the options in Melbourne to me felt just good at best, and downright insulting at worst. Starting from the bottom, you've got Ajisen Ramen. Not much to say here - the flavour profiles are not even close to good. I personally wouldn't really be able to recommend the chain. Next is Ippudo - the Ramen is okay, not terrible but considering the price, it leaves a lot to be desired. For lack of better phrasing, the taste isn't very "clear", and its more "muddy". Finally, Hakata Gensuke does have good ramen! The flavour profile is authentic and very rich! I can definitely recommend Hakata Gensuke for Tonkotsu.

#### Introduction
I recently had the chance to try [Mensousai Mugen](http://www.mensousaimugen.com/) via an recommendation from a ramen enthusiast. I have always preferred Shoyu Ramen over Tonkotsu, which seems to be much more popular in Melbourne, so I was excited to be able to get a good shoyu without having to travel back to Japan! Located off Flinders Lane, it is a little bit difficult to find this establishment. However, it seems to be popular - I arrived approximately 10 minutes after it opened at 6pm, and most of the bottom floor was already filled. They also seemingly don't take bookings - walk-ins only. I tried the Wafu Tsukemen - Dipping Ramen, which was a Dashi and Soy sauce based broth. I chose the Tsukemen variant as I had never tried that before.

#### Noodles
To me, the noodles are actually more important than the broth. This may be an odd opinion, but noodles are how one interfaces with the dish itself. Sure, you can drink the soup, but the benchmark I use is a spoon of noodles infused with the broth! The noodles themselves were brought out and served separately from the soup - hence the name Dipping Ramen. The noodles were wholesome and chewy, which are the exact qualities that I look for in noodles! I did not put in a choice for how firm the noodles were, but they seemed on the firmer side to me. The underlying noodle taste was also detectable depending on how much soup you infused it with. All in all, the noodles were quality which would not hold back the broth in the slightest.

#### Broth
Now, about the broth. The soy taste comes through strongly, which I personally prefer less of. This is definitely a me problem though - I simply used less soup with each spoon of noodles to reduce the intensity of flavour to my liking. Others will be able to cater to their tastes by modulating the amount of soup used, too! This is a benefit of the Tsukemen option as opposed to the Ramen option. The spring onions were fresh bursts of flavour in comparison to the rich umami and slightly tangy broth, which makes for an amazing flavour profile!

#### Overall conclusion
All in all, after writing this review, perhaps I just don't like Tonkotsu Ramen that much, which has led to my opinion of ramen itself being mid. However, being able to get a genuinely delicious shoyu ramen, with my exact noodle preferences has cemented Mensousai Mugen as a place I will certainly visit again many times! I certainly recommend Mensousai Mugen wholeheartedly.
