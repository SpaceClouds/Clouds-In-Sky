Piccolina  was next on my list to visit - I had actually never been, but in the middle of hardware lane, it is always bustling and busy!

The introduction is very short for this one - it is a classic vanilla gelato. However, I noticed that when compared to other gelato that I have tried, it seems to melt very quickly. The temperature was cool enough to have a scarf on, so I'm not certain what this says about the product.

Perhaps this melting of the gelato actually aids the flavour spreading across your taste buds, because it is what I would call the gold standard of great vanilla gelato. The creaminess was good, but the texture itself was noticeably impacted by how quickly it melted. The taste was a tad too sweet for my taste, but for the majority of people I imagine it would be near perfect. The vanilla flavour was very clear and delicious too!

In my opinion, Piccolina's vanilla has stats as follows:
Creaminess: 7
Sweetness: 9
Intensity of Vanilla: 8.5

On the Bulla scale, this makes it a 8/10 which is great!
